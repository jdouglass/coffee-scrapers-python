Thirty-one years ago Maximo inherited Florestales farm, and now lives there with his wife and two of his four children, three cats and one dog. Maximino has been working hard to improve the quality of the coffee he produces by focusing on processing as well as introducing gesha trees to the farm. The team at Florestales maintains environmentally friendly agricultural practices to maintain their integrity of their land. The family also grows citrus fruit, like lemons and oranges as well as yucca and plantains, and their coffee trees are growing beside three hectares of forest that they plan to continue conserving. Florestales is an absolutely stunning property and Maximino is producing some very delicious coffees. We are excited to have his coffees on our menu this year and are looking forward to tasting his coffees in the years to come. <br></p>",

Carmo has spent many years producing and processing amazing coffees in Brazil with a strong focus on quality standards, innovation and local social projects. They not only process coffees grown on their own family farms, they also partner with other producers from farms of all scales to process and export their coffee.</p>\n<p>This farm is 530 hectares in total with 260 hectares planted with coffee. This farm is owned by the third generation of the Pereira family and it continues to produce excellent quality as part of the family's legacy of agriculture in the area. This farm produces mainly Red and Yellow bourbon but also has plots of Acaia, Mundo Novo and Catuai. This lot of Acaia varietal is a cousin of the Mundo Novo varietal bred to deal with lower altitudes and warmer weather while maintaining high potential for top cup quality.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"> </p>",

The terroir in this region make Floripondio an ideal farm for experimenting with growing different types of coffee varieties. Currently, the Rodriguez family have planted Java, Caturra, Gesha, Bourbon, Ethiosar, SL28, SL34, Yellow Pacamara, Batian, as well as a variety garden with over 60 other varieties from all over the world. The hope of this garden is to discover which varieties are best suited for their land and this particular latitude and altitude. At the end of harvest, the various coffee varieties are cupped and decisions are made about which varieties to plant at the other farms of Los Rodriguez. It is a breathtaking farm, growing incredible coffees, and under the guidance of the Rodriguez family the coffees are grown, harvested and processed with close attention to detail every step of the way.</p>",

Then, the farm started with 2 hectares in total with 18,000 caturra and colombia variety trees. Today, the farm has 14.5 hectares of coffee with 90,000 coffee trees and 1.5 hectares of nature reserve. They grow many varieties on their farm such as Java, Pacamara, Tabi, Pink Bourbon, Chiroso Caturra and Catimore.<br></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Edilberto and Nubia had three children, and now the farm is managed by all three who have all been trained in different areas of the family business such as cultivation, processing, cupping and preparation. Carlos, together with his brother Diego, are in charge of most of the logistics on the farm, such as collection processes, selection, and personnel management. Johan, the producer of this coffee, is in charge of qualities, cupping and verifying all the processes. Colombia is on the cutting edge when it comes to new techniques and Las Flores is one the farms leading this charge. After extensive trials with different fermentations, Johan Vergara developed a natural process is nothing short of transformative with intense fruit and huge aromatics. Applied to this Chiroso variety results in the best qualities of both variety and process: Red fruit, sparkling acidity, and deep sweetness.</p>\n<!-- notionvc: 02a799dc-aaaf-42e0-b56a-0ead579f20b8 --><br>",

The lush and vibrant Finca San Luis is nestled into the hillside of the municipality of Líbano, in Tolima, Colombia. Omar works hard to make his farm sustainable and biodiverse - keeping colonies of bees, many different varieties of shrubs and flowers (to attract and sustain the bees and birds in the area), and although San Luis is not formally organic certified, Omar has maintained organic practises on his farm for the last 25 years! Environmental sustainability, respect, and fair treatment of the people who work on and with the farm are part of a strict policy that Omar and his family uphold for San Luis. Omar employs a small team that works on the farm with him year round and at the height of the season he has up to 90 pickers hired from nearby communities. San Luis is truly a labour of love. There is so much intentionality and purpose behind everything that happens on the farm, and we are so proud to have the opportunity to offer his beautiful coffees on our menu.<!-- notionvc: 375e4126-865e-4592-a3d3-39d439f0426c --><br>",

Over the years, through our global travels and competitions, we have discovered not only some of the best coffee producers in the world, but also some of the best roasters as well. At our Britannia location, we are bringing together our favourite roasters from around the world and their best selections alongside our own Monogram roasts. We are excited for people to discover new roasters, new coffees and new taste experiences. With this program we will carefully-select global roasters take an in-house \"residency\" in Britannia, with us working closely with each roaster to bringing the best and most diverse selection of beans. Let's explore the wonderful world of coffee together.<br></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George’s life in coffee began in 1975 with his first café, The Coffee Connection in Cambridge’s Harvard Square. George began roasting for George Howell Coffee in 2004, a decade after selling his 24 \"The Coffee Connection\" cafes to Starbucks in 1994, and 30 years after he started roasting coffee. Fun fact: the Frappuccino was originally developed, trademarked, and named by The Coffee Connection chain.</span></p>\n<p>George Howell Coffee was founded in 2004 with its primary focus being to continually identify, source and roast the highest quality coffees available. George Howell coffee acknowledges and highlights the influence of the region, terroir, and the farmer’s craftsmanship in every bean. <br></p>\n<p>George Howell has a direct trade policy in order to provide maximum incentive to the fine craftspeople who produce what they celebrate. They seek these quality producers through the many networks that George has connected with over his almost fifty years in specialty coffee. Above all, George Howell Coffee aims to share the experience of the highest quality coffee, from seed to cup, with their customers.<br></p>\n<p>We are so happy to have this amazing coffee in our cafes to share with all of you!<br></p>",

Don Humberto left behind a legacy of hard work and dedication to coffee growing to his two children and wife who now carry out his mandate at Buena Vista.</p>\n<p>This gesha was harvested by hand at the peak of maturation to ensure only the sweetest cherries are picked.

Thirty-one years ago Maximo inherited Florestales farm, and now lives there with his wife and two of his four children, three cats and one dog. Maximino has been working hard to improve the quality of the coffee he produces by focusing on processing and introducing new varieties to his farm.</p>\n<p>This is the first gesha we have had from Maximino and the outstanding quality of this coffee is exactly as we would expect from him. Processed a honey, this coffee spends a little bit of time in contact with the fruit while it dries which gives this coffee complexity and sweetness.</p>\n<p>The team at Florestales maintains environmentally friendly agricultural practices to maintain their integrity of their land. The family also grows citrus fruit, like lemons and oranges as well as yucca and plantains, and their coffee trees are growing beside three hectares of forest that they plan to continue conserving. Florestales is an absolutely stunning property and Maximino is producing some very delicious coffees. We are excited to have his coffees on our menu and are looking forward to tasting more of coffees in the years to come.</p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: b35e2c70-e889-42bb-84d5-d701d4c80ce5 --><br></p>\n<!-- notionvc: 02a799dc-aaaf-42e0-b56a-0ead579f20b8 --><br>",
