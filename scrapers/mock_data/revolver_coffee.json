Insanely exciting!</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Located in the precious Marcala region of Honduras that Marysabel Caballero and Moises Herrera put on the coffee map by over 20 years of relentless work. Fast forward, and many Cup of Excellence wins later, they now produce coffee on more than 200 hectares, split into various farms to bring out different cup profiles. </em><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Confite is a new cup category by Caballero: very sweet and almost candy-like. The name is given after a popular candy consisting of dried fruit, nuts or spices coated in sugar candy. Our coffee underwent an extended fermentation, helping to boost this candy quality.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em></em><em>This coffee stood out for its intense fruit flavours and candy-like sweetness: Notes of banana and pineapple are supported by red grapes, berries and dulce de leche. Almost like a desert (Eton Mess), the creamy mouthfeel makes you want to enjoy this coffee over and over again.</em></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Marysabels father Don Fabio operates coffee farms around Marcala. After many years of poor profits, he decided to hand out land to his daughter Marysabel and her husband Moises Herrera. Moises brought his own farms into the family business and together they have almost 200 hectares of coffee split across various fincas.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Four years ago, Caballero began producing Naturals with dedication on improving the process (beans are dried with cherry). In Honduras drying Natural coffees can be challenging. The climate is very humid and it can rain during the drying period. This results in a drying period that can take from 20 up to 40 days, depending on temperatures.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Marysabel and Moises have played a big part in contributing to the growing reputation of Honduran coffees. Everything they do is documented, and considerable resources are invested both in new equipment and planting of new coffee varieties.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>The Caballeros are committed to the environmental sustainability of their farms. A lot of their focus goes towards improving the soil of their farms to ensure a healthy environment. They produce organic fertilizer made from cow and chicken manure mixed with pulp from coffee cherries and other organic material. This is used in addition to some mineral fertilizer to ensure that the coffee plants get the nutrients they need. Oranges, avocados, flowers, bananas and other fruits are also grown at the farms, for the pickers to eat and to create biodiversity at the farms that ensures good growing conditions and shade for the coffee trees.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Process</strong></em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Moises began producing Naturals 3 or so years ago, initially only starting with 30 bags. Drying Natural coffees is very difficult in Honduras because of the humid climate and the rain experienced during the drying period. Moises has perfected the process over the years. They are picking ripe cherry and drying on covered raised beds. Initially the layer of cherry must be thin and as the coffee dries you can increase the thickness of the drying cherry. Cherry can take 20-40 days to dry depending on the temperatures</em></p>\n<br>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </p>",

Aliss and her four siblings grew up at Finca Hartmann, playing amongst the coffee trees and climbing on bags of stored parchment at the mill. As adults, the Hartmann children each took roles at Finca Hartmann – Aliss managing the administrative side of the business. As her own children, Giuliana and Giuseppe grew up, she wanted them to have a similar childhood to herself. She purchased Finca Momoto to teach them the value of the land, respect for nature, and to share with them the same love and passion for coffee that her parents shared with her. Aliss applies an environmentally sustainable approach to coffee production, with most of the coffee from Finca Momoto processed using the natural method, eliminating the need for significant water usage. This lot is a rare heirloom variety brought to Panama many years ago from the coffee forests of Ethiopia. It has thrived in its new home, producing a complex and interesting cup with notes of watermelon and grape.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"product-grid__detail\" id=\"mobile-detail\">\n<div class=\"product-form\"><form data-product-id=\"7765125988568\" data-productid=\"7765125988568\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" class=\"shopify-product-form\" action=\"https://proudmarycoffee.com/cart/add\" method=\"post\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<div class=\"subscription-wrapper\"></div>\n<div class=\"quadd-wrapper quadd-wrapper--with-payment-button\"></div>\n</form></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</main></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Flavio who has vast experience in managing the family businesses met Marcelo who was a recent graduate in the technical school of agriculture and cattle and was eager to explore the farming universe.

In 2010, an opportunity arose and they constituted the first farm, focused on specialty coffee production in Campos Altos region, Minas Gerais. They carefully evaluated each piece of land that would receive the coffee crops, after all the purpose was of producing extraordinary coffees. After a long period looking for the perfect terroir, the farm location was selected, a place that produces the most incredible coffees in the high plateaus of Cerrado Mineiro. The Cerrado is one of the richest biomes in the world in terms of biodiversity, and Bioma Café emerged with the purpose of producing specialty coffees maintaining the balance between agriculture and the Cerrado biome.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </p>",

So Thanks for that!</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>It really came about in the most mundane way, really. We'd cup tables of coffee's &amp; say \"oh man, that coffee's such a juicebomb\" or something to that effect. I was a no brainer to design a bag around that and source some juicy coffees to throw in there. Kenya has always had these coffees that, if roasted right, always felt so deeply sweet &amp; juicy, to the point that your pallet is whetted in just the right way &amp; it keeps you coming back for more. Did this just get NSFW?!<br></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>HA! Nah, but for real, we love this Ibonia estate lot...there's a bunch so Hopefully it's around for a while. Here's to another year of JB &amp; here's to y'all for making this a thing. LOVE.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em><strong>KENYA</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Working with the same Co-Op/Factory/Estate &amp; having consistent quality is tough. Each year we have to hope to get something that we ultimately love, from a source we have worked with before &amp; something we know  everyone can enjoy. Kenyan coffees are some of the most expensive, that's reflective in the pricing as you're probably all aware of if you're fans. In all honesty, every year we definitely have a cap on what we can spend at origin, but we make sure to make less on our Kenyan just so we can offer it as accessibly as possible. It's the real deal. That's our reality with Kenya right now but we have plans for the future to shake up the system &amp; get closer to the people that make these incredible complex cups of coffee possible.</em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Located only three miles from Kiambu Town, Ibonia Estate spans nearly 200 hectares - 60% of which is natural forest, wetlands, rivers and wildlife. The rest is dedicated to coffee, which is worked by around 200 workers during the harvest.<br>The soil is rich and red Kikuyu loam, the genetics are dominated by SL28s, and the management practices are top-notch.</strong></em></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Kenya is an enigma. It occupies a top spot in specialty – Kenyan top lots are always amongst the most expensive of any harvest. But yet it’s a country where coffee production is dropping year over year. Kenya is a place where traceability is given, but knowing what you want and how to get it are two different things. Rarely do we find partners more capable, and loyalties more difficult to navigate than we do in Kenya. For all the aforementioned reasons, competition in Kenya is fierce, making prized coffees feel like even more of a success.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, no matter how formally the industry is structured, coffee still remains a system of people. And in a country where farmers own their own cherry production, there is additional power to connecting with coffee’s most important stakeholder. Farmers can, for example, point you to the best collections from every harvest, or delay sending their lots to auction to give you another week to sample. At request they can change the way they separate lots, bringing new products to market in a year that would take other countries nearly a decade to do.</em><br><em>But experimentation is not the name of the game. With washed coffees working so well, you won’t find many a manager willing to mess around with different fermentations, flotation, drying times or with certifications like organic.</em><br><em>The experiment instead is that of business model. How do cooperatives normalize earnings to keep their members engaged in coffee? How do we take away red tape to encourage more farmers to plant more coffee, as opposed to corn or dairy? How can small estates split off and succeed under their own pulping license? Is it better to sell through auction or directly to an international buyer – can you afford to cut out your marketing agent? Once you speak to these problems you are speaking the language of coffee in Kenya – this is a country that already knows how to \"coffee\".</em></p>",

At his processing station in Aceh-Pantan Musara Village, Hendra purchases cherry from 50 farmers surrounding his wet mill.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Led by Hendra Maulizar, the Gegaring Team produces some of the highest quality, most sought after micro lots in all of Indonesia. They are processing these coffees in the mountains of central Aceh in North Sumatra. Winning 16th &amp; 7th in back to back Cup of Excellence showings.</em><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>Hendra works with three farms in Aceh Gayo. He makes himself available to watch over the entire process from start to finish while relying on a team of incredible producers who work together to see each other succeed. Most of their coffees fly under the banner name of Pegasing, where the coffees are farmed and collected into central facilities. Fusing innovations in fermentation and drying with Sumatra's unique varieties, Hendra has made his team of producers and his methods the premier pioneering act in Sumatra specialty coffee processes.</em><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em> <br></em><em><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></strong></em><em>To talk about Sumatra we need to speak of its size. It’s large. Larger than Texas and Florida combined. In the middle of the island is a caldera called Lake Toba: the largest caldera from the largest volcanic explosion this world has ever seen.</em><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>In this lake there is an island bigger than the country of Singapore. It is because of this lake that Sumatra has the largest rainfall seen by any coffee exporting country – the lake feeds clouds trapped in by the island’s 1500m tall mountains. Sumatra is old. When Marco Polo visited the island’s northern tip back in 1292, he found the local people speaking Sanskrit, one of the purest remaining forms of the ancient language. When the Dutch East Indian Trading Company came, Aceh (and later Java) became the first commercial coffee origins that the world had seen.Sumatra is big; I know we already said that, but it is really, really big. There are over 52 languages over four major ethnic groups (Acehnese, Minangkabaunese, Batak and Mala) covering an area over 170,500 square miles around. However big the island, however, there is only one government-authorized port of export – the 15 million person city of Medan. To get here, coffee has to travel as far as 375 miles, over massive mountains and on roads that are mostly still mud. That’s 20 hours north to the producing regions Gayo Aceh, or 24 hours to the southern most Arabica regions in Kerinci. And this is the main reason that Sumatran coffee is hulled while wet, and dried while in the green. Called Giling Basah, this process starts with coffee parchment being dried to 30-50% moisture before being milled into green beans. Higher moisture during transport from the farm to the port can lend to the classic ‘earthy, musty’ flavors that you get in some Sumatrans. Another source of Sumatra’s unique flavors dates back to the turn of the 20th century when Indonesia’s coffee crop was wiped out by leaf rust. Much of this was replaced with HDT (Hybrid de Timor) (Bourbon x Robusta), its direct descendant Tim Tim, or the more modern Sigarar Utang (Tim Tim x Bourbon).</em><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em>And these are Robusta-Arabica hybrids; over the generations these have only added more Arabica through crossing Tim-Tim and with Sigarar Utang (Ateng). But there are pure Arabica strains as well, like Jember (Bourbon x Typica), USDA (Ethiopian Arabica transplant), and Onan Ganjan (Jember x Bourbon). So the genetic stock is absolutely unique. But what makes Sumatra truly unique are Sumatrans. As a new generation takes the reigns, they are taking the country headlong into specialty. The past years have seen an explosion of washed coffees, naturals, honeys, new varietals, new regions and new ways of thinking about Sumatra’s role in specialty coffee. Not just locally, but regionally –Indonesian coffee has so much to offer, and so much of what comes out of Bali, Flores, Timor and Sulawesi comes through Sumatra.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </p>",
