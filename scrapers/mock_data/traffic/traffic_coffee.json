A family man—he has 11 children with his two wives—Bekele operates his farms and drying stations with the help of his family. His son, Beleteno, who graduated this year from Hawassa University with an economics degree, manages his Hora Ganet farm (which means “Spring Paradise”). Between his farm in Bombe and a smaller, 5 hectare farm in Kokose (with its own drying station), Bekele purchases cherry from more than 100 smallholders, producing a total of 1.5 containers of coffee. Like many collectors in Ethiopia, his bottleneck, with cherry prices as high as they are, is financing. Bekele is a connector and a consummate professional—an ideal partner, willing to engage with every idea for improving his coffee and helping his community. During our visit, Bekele expanded his shaded drying area to cover nearly his entire station, protecting the natural process coffees—traditional, anaerobic and lactic styles—he produced there, and verifying their final moisture content with a moisture meter.</p>",

A member of the larger Kiru Farmers Cooperative Society, the Ndiara washing station started operations in 1999, making steady improvements to infrastructure - namely pulpers, drying beds and water purification – with the rest of the premiums they earn through quality going back to members.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>KENYA</strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Kenya is an enigma. It occupies a top spot in specialty – Kenyan top lots are always amongst the most expensive of any harvest. Yet it’s a country where coffee production is dropping year over year. Kenya is a place where traceability is given, but knowing what you want and how to get it are two different things. Rarely do we find partners more capable, and loyalties more difficult to navigate than we do in Kenya. For all the aforementioned reasons, competition in Kenya is fierce,making prized coffees feel like even more of a success.</p>",

Beginning in 2014, he shifted his focus to specialty coffee production, investing in post-harvest processing<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">experimentation and facilities—such as a wet mill, gravitation washing channels, and raised drying beds. His innovationand pursuit of quality has led to Hendra winning #7 in the Cup of Excellence Indonesia competition in 2021 and #16 in<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">2022. At his processing station in Aceh-Pantan Musara Village, Hendra purchases cherry from 50 farmers surrounding his wet mill.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>THE GREGARING TEAM</strong><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Led by Hendra Maulizar, the Gegaring Team produces some of the highest quality, most sought after micro lots in all of Indonesia. They are processing these coffees in the mountains of central Aceh in North Sumatra. Winning 16th &amp; 7th in back to back Cup of Excellence showings.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Hendra works with three farms in Aceh Gayo. He makes himself available to watch over the entire process from start to finish while relying on a team of incredible producers who work together to see each other succeed. Most of their coffees fly under the banner name of Pegasing, where the coffees are farmed and collected into central facilities. Fusing innovations in fermentation and drying with Sumatra's unique varieties, Hendra has made his team of producers and his methods the premier pioneering act in Sumatra specialty coffee processes.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>INDONESIA</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\">To talk about Sumatra we need to speak of its size. It’s large. Larger than Texas and Florida combined. In the middle of the island is a caldera called Lake Toba: the largest caldera from the largest volcanic explosion this world has ever seen.<br>In this lake there is an island bigger than the country of Singapore. It is because of this lake that Sumatra has the largest rainfall seen by any coffee exporting country – the lake feeds clouds trapped in by the island’s 1500m tall mountains. Sumatra is old. When Marco Polo visited the island’s northern tip back in 1292, he found the local people speaking Sanskrit, one of the purest remaining forms of the ancient language. When the Dutch East Indian Trading Company came, Aceh (and later Java) became the first commercial coffee origins that the world had seen.Sumatra is big; I know we already said that, but it is really, really big. There are over 52 languages over four major ethnic groups (Acehnese, Minangkabaunese, Batak and Mala) covering an area over 170,500 square miles around. However big the island, however, there is only one government-authorized port of export – the 15 million person city of Medan. To get here, coffee has to travel as far as 375 miles, over massive mountains and on roads that are mostly still mud. That’s 20 hours north to the producing regions Gayo Aceh, or 24 hours to the southern most Arabica regions in Kerinci. And this is the main reason that Sumatran coffee is hulled while wet, and dried while in the green. Called Giling Basah, this process starts with coffee parchment being dried to 30-50% moisture before being milled into green beans. Higher moisture during transport from the farm to the port can lend to the classic ‘earthy, musty’ flavors that you get in some Sumatrans. Another source of Sumatra’s unique flavors dates back to the turn of the 20th century when Indonesia’s coffee crop was wiped out by leaf rust. Much of this was replaced with HDT (Hybrid de Timor) (Bourbon x Robusta), its direct descendant Tim Tim, or the more modern Sigarar Utang (Tim Tim x Bourbon).<br>And these are Robusta-Arabica hybrids; over the generations these have only added more Arabica through crossing Tim-Tim and with Sigarar Utang (Ateng). But there are pure Arabica strains as well, like Jember (Bourbon x Typica), USDA (Ethiopian Arabica transplant), and Onan Ganjan (Jember x Bourbon). So the genetic stock is absolutely unique. But what makes Sumatra truly unique are Sumatrans. As a new generation takes the reigns, they are taking the country headlong into specialty. The past years have seen an explosion of washed coffees, naturals, honeys, new varietals, new regions and new ways of thinking about Sumatra’s role in specialty coffee. Not just locally, but regionally –Indonesian coffee has so much to offer, and so much of what comes out of Bali, Flores, Timor and Sulawesi comes through Sumatra.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p>",

Each year we have to hope to get something that we ultimately love, from a source we have worked with before &amp; something we know  everyone can enjoy. Kenyan coffees are some of the most expensive, that's reflective in the pricing as you're probably all aware of if you're fans. In all honesty, every year we definitely have a cap on what we can spend at origin, but we make sure to make less on our Kenyan just so we can offer it as accessibly as possible. It's the real deal. That's our reality with Kenya right now but we have plans for the future to shake up the system &amp; get closer to the people that make these incredible complex cups of coffee possible.<br></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Located only three miles from Kiambu Town, Ibonia Estate spans nearly 200 hectares - 60% of which is natural forest, wetlands, rivers and wildlife. The rest is dedicated to coffee, which is worked by around 200 workers during the harvest.<br>The soil is rich and red Kikuyu loam, the genetics are dominated by SL28s, and the management practices are top-notch.</strong></p>\nKenya is an enigma. It occupies a top spot in specialty – Kenyan top lots are always amongst the most expensive of any harvest. But yet it’s a country where coffee production is dropping year over year. Kenya is a place where traceability is given, but knowing what you want and how to get it are two different things. Rarely do we find partners more capable, and loyalties more difficult to navigate than we do in Kenya. For all the aforementioned reasons, competition in Kenya is fierce, making prized coffees feel like even more of a success.\n<p>However, no matter how formally the industry is structured, coffee still remains a system of people. And in a country where farmers own their own cherry production, there is additional power to connecting with coffee’s most important stakeholder. Farmers can, for example, point you to the best collections from every harvest, or delay sending their lots to auction to give you another week to sample. At request they can change the way they separate lots, bringing new products to market in a year that would take other countries nearly a decade to do.<br> But experimentation is not the name of the game. With washed coffees working so well, you won’t find many a manager willing to mess around with different fermentations, flotation, drying times or with certifications like organic.<br> The experiment instead is that of business model. How do cooperatives normalize earnings to keep their members engaged in coffee? How do we take away red tape to encourage more farmers to plant more coffee, as opposed to corn or dairy? How can small estates split off and succeed under their own pulping license? Is it better to sell through auction or directly to an international buyer – can you afford to cut out your marketing agent? Once you speak to these problems you are speaking the language of coffee in Kenya – this is a country that already knows how to \"coffee\".</p>",

Objectively, I get it...It kinda sounds like something your dad would drink but, in reality, Colombia boasts some of the most complex coffees on the planet &amp; whether it's washed, natural, or some other experimental process, the farming &amp; processing pedigree that comes with being in the trade for so many generations shines through.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This coffee comes from our good friend Valentina Duque.

It is an agricultural centre where the cultivation of coffee occupies an important place. The cooperative started operating in 1967. The members of the cooperative have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in producing and selling coffee, thanks to the support of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Caldas. The cooperative operates in the municipalities of Anserma, Risaralda, San José, Belalcázar and Viterbo. Its main purpose is the sale of coffee and other agricultural products, while it also strives to promote and improve the economic, social, technical and cultural conditions of the members. The cooperative has 2,083 associated coffee growers who cultivate coffee of excellent quality with dedication and passion. In addition to coffee they also grow crops like sugarcane and bananas. With Luis Miguel' arrival as a general manager, the cooperative has sought to incorporate recent technological advances in the processing and to embrace the shift towards specialty coffee production. Temperature-controlled areas have been built in the warehouse for processing the microlots that the producers deliver. The experiments with producing naturally processed lots have also started in a manner that does not pose risks for the producers. </p>",

The coffee industry there is also very much a “boys club”, as it is in most countries but, Brazil even more so. That’s kinda what drove us to work with Yuki Minami, which is how we also met Marcelo but, yuki being the “godmother” if you will, of all these incredible farms, producers, and processing recipes that hit the mark every time was a driving force for the decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These Forca Café coffees however, are based in another relationship group made possible by a woman named Gerra Harrigan. Gerra &amp; I met serendipitously chatting via emaila dn Whatsapp about some Costa Rican producers &amp; now, years later, we have these awesome competition coffees from Brazil that we’re so stoked about, like this one, &amp; a chance this year to go judge on the panel for Forca Café itself! <br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coffee is yellow Catuai, anaerobically fermented, to give a crazy complex cup from arguably my favorite coffee origin. It’s got massive body &amp; is super sweet full of ripe white guava and lactic strawberry. This is tied up with an amazingly complex dark chocolate finish. It's such a surprising coffee every sip in, we're not surprised it placed in the top 10.<br></span></p>\n<p> </p>",

The prices of coffee are wayyyy up, &amp; will continue to rise due to the pandemic &amp; mother nature which has cut crop yields. Just today, the 19th of September 2022, as we write this we have heard that Brazil is down almost 40% which is very dire news for coffee prices.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy this while it lasts &amp; remember that we're lucky to have amazing coffees, for now.

The civilization disappeared mysteriously before the arrival of the Spanish Conquerors. Little is known as to exactly what happened and the only thing that was left behind were the burial sites. These sites were discovered in 1960 by explorers and the archaeological park “El Alto de Los Idolos”, the home to these burial sites, was founded.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The coffee growers from this region initially got together to share ideas and form groups to facilitate the sale of their coffees. The group has always been quality focused and members currently working on standardizing practices, improving their overall processes as well as their drying patios.

Through many years of working as a green buyer and coffee roaster,  gaps in specialty buying became increasingly clear -- in broad strokes, a pattern of competing for top lots produced by well resourced, trained and educated producers became evident while communities seeking access were often overlooked.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\"><br></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">For Semilla, coffee is more than the seed of a tropical fruit that can be transformed into a delicious beverage with proper care along all stages. It's a material that connects history, society, politics, culture, international policy, philosophy, and more. It contains years and year of hard work, and it directly affects the livelihoods of millions the world over. So, the question becomes, how do we maximize the specialty market so that we can make the biggest impact on the most amount of people, while also brining forth a high quality product to the end consumer?</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\"><br></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">In our small part, we can commit to specific communities who have the energy and passion to connect to the specialty market and we can <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">broaden and deepen our commitment to them</span> rather than buying only the top lots. We can speak about coffees as the product of people rather than only for its sensory attributes. And we can work in close collaboration with these groups to listen to what they need to succeed - from meeting the prices they request, to investing in a physical and intellectual infrastructure that will allow them to thrive in this market.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\"><br></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">In short,  we commit to the slow and steady work of buying solid coffees from producers without access, and seeking to see the rising tide float all boats.</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">This isn’t common, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better, but we choose our paths for a reason — what’s yours?</span></p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"> </p>\n<p class=\"font_9\" style=\"line-height: 1.875em; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;\"> </p>\n</div>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0085/8977/0818/files/LenoandHugo_480x480.jpg?v=1667313025\" alt=\"\"></strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">About Hugo, Coffee, &amp; Honduras in his words<br></strong></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">My farm was founded by my maternal grandparents, they were the ones who<br>started to grow coffee. After many years they bequeathed the farm to my<br>parents but my father had left the farm very abandoned.<br></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">At 14 year old I started working the farm. For fertilizer, I used cattle manure and<br>it was also at that age that I started to sprout my own seedlings to have new<br>plantations in the finca. The variety that I reproduced was yellow catuai.<br>When I eventually ran out of space to plant more trees, my father inherited<br>another portion of land where I made another new plantation.<br></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Five years later I bought another piece of land from my uncle and in 1998, he<br>allowed me to plant another plot on a piece of forest land that he owned.<br>In the year 2000 I emigrated to the United States for 5 years. The reason was<br>that there was no possibility of a fair market in coffee at that time. After 5<br>years, I returned with money I made to maintain my farm and continue<br>working in what I truely enjoy, which is coffee.<br></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">For me, being able to export my coffee this year, for the very first time, is<br>something unique. Since I was able to receive a better sales price and have<br>more profitability from my property, I hope to be able to export more coffee<br>from my farm in the future. I hope to be able to travel one day to Canada and<br>see the great work done by the friends who buy our coffee from us.<br></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">I try to keep my farm away from pesticides and triazoles, I only work with soil<br>fertilization and weed cleaning, I have regulated shade for coffee, to simulate<br>a forest and maintain diversity in the region.<br>We started alongside my colleagues in the resistance against chemical silver<br>mining in 2013, we are still present in the resistance today.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>About Cafe Colis Resistencia</strong><br><br>Cafe Colis Resistencia is the name created by Alex Reynoso to identify coffee<br>producing members of the Indigenous Xinka community around<br>Mataquescuintla who are interested in developing an international market for<br>their coffee, and therefore finally receiving fair prices for their work.<br>Within Mataquescuintla and area, nearly 90% of the population identifies as a<br>coffee producer and yet, almost none of these producers have access to a<br>market beyond selling in cherry to local intermediaries or to large farms who<br>process their coffee and sell it as blended lots to their international market.<br>While theoretically the price of cherry is decided in relation to the New York<br>Stock Exchange coffee commodity price, really anything goes for these<br>buyers. As producers have little to no option, they simply sell to whoever they<br>can, and accept whatever price is offered.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br>This year, of course, things changed. Throughout the harvest, we saw steadily<br>increasing prices as buyers fought over low yielding farms while the<br>commodity market price soared to heights unseen in years. As we’ve said<br>many times over, the fact that prices are higher is always a good thing<br>however, due to the rampant pace of global inflation throughout this year<br>many farmers didn’t see this price boost as a profit windfall but as the same<br>thing but different.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br>To put into context what it means for prices to “go up” locally, it was often the<br>case for us to hear over the last three years prices as low as 115-130 Quetzal<br>for 100 pounds of cherry. Taking a yield factor of 1:4.5 - 1:5, that equalled 585 -<br>650 Quetzal per quintal of parchment coffee, which is roughly $0.82USD/lb.<br>This year, it took until the end of the year - when coffee was becoming<br>increasingly scarce - for these buyers who were paying their highest ever<br>prices to arrive to 300 Quetzal/quintal of cherry, roughly in line with the 1500<br>Quetzal/quintal parchment we’ve been paying previously.<br><br>As a means of solidarity with the group for their patience in waiting for the<br>end of the harvest to be paid, as well as in consideration for their increased<br>costs, we increased our pricing by 20$ to 1750-1775 Quetzal/quintal<br>parchment this year. Likely, we won’t bring this down ever again, though we’re<br>quite sure that the market will begin to trend down again. Even if the<br>commodity market stays high, the return to average or above average crop<br>cycles will likely lead to much less speculation on the local level.<br>Aside from this price spike, the same structures we’ve seen since day one<br>continue to pervade for smallholders in Guatemala, and the smallholders we<br>work with continue to receive little or no support for their country as regards<br>their coffee production.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br>Indeed, Guatemala’s history of coffee production has always erred to the<br>support of major landowners of European or Mestizo descent, and relied upon<br>the forced labor of Indigenous people to claim its place as one of Central<br>America’s largest coffee producers (Read more about the mandamiento<br>system.). This violent and painful system leaves its vestigial remains in the<br>monopolio that exists today — in short, a system of production and export in<br>which the government supports major landholders while holding back<br>resources and access to small producers such as those in Mataquescuintla.<br>This monopoly not only keeps producers away from the market access they<br>need for truly sustainable prices, but it also keeps them away from technical<br>assistance and education that could propel them forward. As such, producers<br>like Juan are left to fend for themselves in this incredibly challenging<br>transition from a lifetime of selling in cherry to processing and drying their<br>own coffee for sale as micro-lots. This lack of assistance is only underscored<br>by the closure in the last few years of Anacafe’s technical assistance office in<br>Mataquescuintla. Despite being one of the highest altitude areas in<br>Guatemala, with some of the highest potential quality for coffee, Anacafe<br>chose to remove themselves citing in part the protests against the mine.</p>",

Times were real tough back then in La Belle Province but \"Grandm'man\" made it through cuz they made em tough back in the day! Super delicious, produced uniquely by girl power in Guatemala, we hope to continue to have the privilege of buying from them and roasting up this great green as a 90's style throwback to oldschool coffee.<br></p>\n<p>Finca Santa Margarita is the family farm of Camila Topke, a trader at InterAmerican Coffee. Santa Margarita is in large part operated by women. In addition to women coffee pickers, women are in charge of the grafting program and of running the farm's school and health clinic.</p>\n<p>Camila is a member of the International Women's Coffee Alliance (<a href=\"https://www.womenincoffee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IWCA</a>) and for a time was vice president of the IWCA Guatemala chapter. She was also instrumental in developing Santa Margarita's forward-looking environmental programs and is still very active in its management.</p>\n<h4>Finca Santa Margarita</h4>\n<p>The farm was founded in 1838 by Thomas Wyld (Camila’s great grandfather) and has been in the family or four generations. Today, Santa Margarita is 2,320 hectares—812 of which are coffee farm—with Caturra, Sarchimor, Catimor and Geisha varieties. The rest is dedicated natural forest land, devoted to the promotion of natural species and wildlife biodiversity.</p>\n<p>The farm has three springs, which are protected by environmental policies and provide water to the people living on the farm, as well as to the wet mill.</p>\n<p>Environmental sustainability is a key mission of Finca Santa Margarita, from the moment seeds are planted to the moment coffee leaves the farm. Its management practices are based on an agroforestry system that includes low intakes of agrochemicals, the use of organic, compost-based soil nutrition, high shade coverage and sustainable quality standards.</p>\n<p>The farm also takes very seriously the quality of life of the workers on the farm. It houses an elementary school for children who live on Santa Margarita, as well as neighboring farms (there are 75 children in the school in total). The farm also includes a small church and health clinic that partner with the Guatemala Dept. of Health.</p>\n<h4>Processing</h4>\n<p>Coffee is washed and dried on patios, as well as on raised African beds. A goal of the farm is to build a cupping facility on site and to train workers to cup and be advocates for quality.</p>",

They’re harsh critics, &amp; rightly so, it’s a tradition to uphold. While our interpretation of Italian roast contains no Robusta because of certain standard requirements we have here, this coffee is pushed to the deep, dark reaches of coffee roasting to give you that bold taste that pairs outstandingly with milk, or as an espresso with your favourite zeppoli!</span></p>\n<p>Dante St. ….what can I say...I smell pizza, I smell cannolis, coffee....I feel like an Italian in my city. When I was a child my best friends parents brought us to Quincallerie Dante (ON DANTE) it was such a polarizing shop, I thought. Guns &amp; Kitchen gear. I was too young to make the distinction between hunting weapons &amp; anything you’d see on COPS. Still, the store was magical to me &amp; remains one of the places I visit every time I’m in Little Italy. That area is full of life, spirit, &amp; that same unidentifiable quality I found so charming all those years ago. You could say this is my tip of the hat to the Italians I grew up with, &amp; the ones that still put up with me today!</p>\n<p>Design by Safwan from Imago Tattoo Montreal<br><br></p>",

Marcelo &amp; Flavio's commitment to quality &amp; excellence is why, for years to come, we will be working with them &amp; Bioma/Aequitas, on these farms. This year, this natural is so clean, you'd think it was a washed coffee. Sweet, rich, very heavy body that pairs beautifully with milk, &amp; as an espresso, finishes with a very subtle lime/tropical note. VERY low acidity coffee for those who aren't fond of bright cups ; )</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>About the Farm</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bioma Café’s story begins back in 2001 when<span> </span><span>Marcelo</span><span> </span>Nogueira Assis and Flavio Marcio Silva met each other and committed their life purposes in farming. Both,<span> </span><span>Marcelo</span><span> </span>and Flavio, were born in families that carry the agriculture DNA. Flavio who has vast experience in managing the family businesses met<span> </span><span>Marcelo</span><span> </span>who was a recent graduate in the technical school of agriculture and cattle and was eager to explore the farming universe. As a result, they formed a partnership based on love for agriculture, respect, and reciprocity.                       <br> </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee is a passion for most people that live in Cerrado, in the state of Minas Gerais and it wasn't different for the young entrepreneurs who were born and raised among coffee plantations. In 2010, an opportunity arose and they constituted the first farm, focused on specialty coffee production in Campos Altos region, Minas Gerais. They carefully evaluated each piece of land that would receive the coffee crops, after all the purpose was of producing extraordinary coffees. After a long period looking for the perfect terroir, the farm location was selected, a place that produces the most incredible coffees in the high plateaus of Cerrado Mineiro. The Cerrado is one of the richest biomes in the world in terms of biodiversity, and Bioma Café emerged with the purpose of producing specialty coffees maintaining the balance between agriculture and the Cerrado biome. </p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
