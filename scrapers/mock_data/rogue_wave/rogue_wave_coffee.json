Both were representing Brazil at the World Barista championship and World Brewers Cup, respectively. I (Ply) personally owe a lot to Garam, since I borrowed his kettles for my competition. Both Lissette and I had the honour of helping out Boram during his world barista training in Calgary, earlier in 2023 before the World championship in Athens Greece where he was crowned the World Champion.<br></p>\n<p>Not only are they fantastic coffee professionals, their family also produces very high quality coffee. The Um family have several cafes in São Paulo, and provide one of the best Barista educations in Brazil. It is our absolute honour to roast Um's coffee for you. <br></p>\n<p>In the photos - Fazenda Um, Ply and Boram about to harvest some coffee, Um Family dinner before competition (with Forward Coffee team who helped bring this coffee to Canada). <br></p>\n<details open=\"\"> <summary><strong> <span class=\"headline\"> More about Fazenda Um</span> </strong></summary>\n<div class=\"indent-content\">\n<p>Coming from completely non-traditional coffee farmers, Fazenda Um began in an abandoned farm in South of Minas Gerais in 2009. Stefano Um, son of South Korean Immigrants in Brazil, was never involved with producing coffee in his life until he began thinking about retirement. Stefano lived and grew up in the country side in Korea before moving to Brazil at the age of 12, which always brought wonderful memories of his childhood in a rice field in South Korea. With a deep desire to live in the countryside, Fazenda Um, began unpretentiously as a retirement plan. However, once Stefano began producing coffee with deep passion for high quality, and traceability when exporting his lots to his first Asian clients, he saw the unlockable potential of high quality Brazilian coffee.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">In 2014, the Um family, together with sons Boram and Garam, embarked in the specialty coffee journey. Boram specialized in coffee quality by becoming a Q-grader and selecting to work on innovations for coffee processing. Garam focused his education on SCA courses and teaching thousands of baristas and coffee enthusiasts in Brazil. Together, Um Coffee Co. was founded. This is a coffee shop, roastery and coffee school in the largest city in Brazil, Sao Paulo. Being in the heart of the big city, Um Coffee Co quickly became a reference in specialty coffee culture in Brazil, being voted the best coffee shop in Sao Paulo 3 times.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Today, Um Coffee Co is focused on expanding and elevating Brazilian coffee through competitions and innovation in the production level. Boram the current World Barista Champion and Garam the current 3rd place world Brewers Cup Champin are focused respectively on innovations at farm level as well as service level.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">With Fazenda Um Espírito Santo, Um Coffee Co's secondary property of 28 hectares, began in 2015. A very limited region that resembles the high mountains of Central America. In 2019, this property was acquired by the Um Family, to work with some of the most exclusive and complex terroirs in Brazil. Espírito Santo today has the most promising coffee lots in terms of quality due to its similarity to other renowned regions of the world, bringing soft umami flavours such as tomato juice and high sweetness impact such as sugarcane. Due to it's complexity and unique microclimate, Um Coffee is producing some new lots and developing intensely, processing techniques in order to unlock the regions full potential. <br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This Yellow Bourbon is one of the most produced varietals in all of Brazil. This specific lot is the first experimentation with shade-grown coffee on the farm. Selectively picked and produced in the deep forest of the Espírito Santo property. The microclimate, where the trees are grown is a cool 23 - 26C year round, keeping it cool. Surprisingly, the cherry maturation is very homogenous, allowing cherry picking to occur twice in every tree.<br></p>\n</div>\n</details>",

The farm has been in the Guardia family for more than 100 years but has focused exclusively on specialty coffee since 1999. During the \"Piramide\" drying process, the coffees are covered early in the afternoon when the temperature is hot, then piled up in a pyramid layered way to modulate the temperature of the cherries throughout the day. This helps to even out the fermentation and avoid development of \"boozy\" flavours sometimes associated with naturals. These evolving tactics plus impeccable organization and dedication to sustainability makes this one of the most progressive farms in Costa Rica.</p>",

You enter through tin gates which open onto lush green grass and, if you’re lucky, smiling day laborers lined up clapping and whistling their excitement at your visit. The Demeka Becha site is owned by Ayele Tulu, a Sidama man who is deeply integrated into the local area of Bona Zuria. His son, Tsegab Ayele, manages the project.<br></span></p>\n<p><span>Demeka Becha site buys cherries from nearby communities including Dilla Suke, Demeka, Goacho, Becha, and Bashiro Dale—close to 10,000 producers are situated in the areas surrounding the washing station. Producers bring their cherries to be weighed on the blue scale, logged in the book by Cashier and General Manager, Alemu Gobaro, and floated before being dumped into the cement hopper to begin the journey through the 4-disk Agard pulper and into fermentation tanks and cement washing channels. There are 10 tanks for density grades 1 and 2, and 2 tanks for low density coffee destined for our Community Lot program or for the local market. Following fermentation and washing, the parchment coffee is carried by hand to the drying beds where laborers spread it out to the depth of a fingertip and keep it turning until it is dried and moved to the locked storehouse to await trucking to Addis Ababa and final processing. <br></span></p>\n<p><span>This particular coffee is a Natural Experimental Fermentation processing, starting with ripe cherries. Once they reach the washing station, we pay an additional premium for them to undergo special handling - first placed into float tanks so lower-density cherries can be skimmed off, leaving the highest density fruit to sink. At this stage in a typical natural process, the remaining high density cherries will be moved to the beds, but this Natural Experimental Process has undergone another critical fermentation step.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The high density cherries are placed in sealed off barrels which offsets the oxygen and allows the coffee to ferment in a an oxygen-limited environment for period of 96 hours in a cool area. While the oxygen within the environment is not entirely controlled, the resulting fermentation is of a pseudo-spontaneous nature, meaning it is impacted by naturally occurring and non-manipulated environmental yeasts.<br><br>Post-fermentation, the cherries are carried to open-air drying tables that are shaded by mesh canopies and they laid out to slowly let the sun kiss them and draw out their moisture content. Once the cherries reach their ideal drying level, they are bagged up and kept carefully separate as they are transported first to a regional processing mill.<br></span></p>",

    "body_html": "<p> </p>\n<p>The Deri Kidame washing station is named for the Deri Kidame kebele, or town, where it is located in the Wamena district of Ethiopia’s Guji zone. The area has fertile red brown soil and Cordia Africana and Acacia Ensete ventricosum trees for shade, benefiting the coffee plants grown by the many smallholder farmers who contribute cherries to the washing station. Coffee farms in the area range 2000–2100 meters above sea level in elevation. The washing station is outfitted with 10 fermentation tanks and 181 raised drying beds which are assigned individual codes, allowing for improved traceability and a higher level of control and tracking throughout the drying process.</p>\n<p>This lot of coffee underwent Natural processing at the Deri Kidame washing station. Coffee cherries are sorted to remove less dense fruit prior to processing. The cherries are then moved to raised beds where they are dried for approximately 18 days.</p>\n<p><span>Guji is a zone in the Oromia Region of southern Ethiopia. Most residents of this region are Oromo and speak the Oromo language, which is entirely different from Ethiopia’s main language of Amharic. Like many of the country’s coffee growing regions, the culture of the Guji Zone varies from woreda to woreda and speaks to the diversity of people who cultivate coffee. More small washing stations are being built in Guji to respond to the demand for improvements in processing to fully capture the range of attributes found in Ethiopian coffee. The Zone’s principal fresh water source is the Ganale Dorya river, which also acts as the boundary line with the neighboring Bale zone to the east.</span></p>",

Run by three amazing individuals and located outside of a small township called Pinlaung. The founder of the project is an American woman named Melanie Edwards. She's been living in Southeast Asia for over a decade and first moved there with the intention of bringing a sustainable source of clean water to remote areas in Thailand and soon after, Myanmar.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are two operations that function simultaneously. The first is Behind the Leaf. That's the name of the micro-mill they've built with the intention of organizing nearby villages to produce coffee at a higher tier of quality and to educate them on the potential that this crop can yield. For these nearby villages, many of them are not connected to stable power sources, many don't have roadways and are truly off the grid. On top of that, Myanmar is the second largest producer of opium in the World, and people like Melanie and her team are working to connect with them and to help them develop a more sustainable life. </span></p>\n<p><span>One initiative that Behind the Leaf is doing is sustainable water systems. </span>After working with a chemical engineer in Cambodia in the early 2000's Melanie learned how to build clay water filtration systems. That knowledge as well as the Christian church was what originally led her to Myanmar, as she could benefit the people in rural communities by providing clean water. People such as the indigenous group referred to as Pa-o. Here she founded a company with two Myanmar locals and began building and distributing these water filters. They're built with rice husks infused into ceramic, to give it the proper porosity and paired with silver nitrate to act as the filter and strip the toxins. The water that comes out the other side is noticeably clean and very nice to drink.</p>\n<p>We visited Behind the Leaf project in Myanmar in early 2023. <br></p>",

Try grinding a little bit finer than usual, and tighten up your usual ratio. For example, if you generally do 1:16, try 1:15 as your starting point. <br></p>\n<p> </p>\n<br>",

    "body_html": "<p><strong>Each pack contains 40-45g of coffee.</strong></p>\n<p>Ninety Plus Gesha estate in Panama almost needs no introduction as one of the most famous farms in the worId of coffee competition. They have produced the winning coffee for 5 of the last 6 world brewers cup champions. In order to compensate for the very high cost of green coffee, we think that roasting smaller amounts to order will be of interest to many in the coffee community.</p>\n<p><strong>Each pack contains 40-45g of coffee.</strong> These coffees are roasted on our Ikawa micro-roaster. We roast 50g of green coffee for each order and hand sort the beans to remove any roast defects. This results in a varying amount of coffee in each bag.</p>\n<p><strong>Brewing Tips: </strong>Since these are roasted on a small roaster, we recommend brewing this coffee within 4 weeks of the roast date. <strong>Perci: </strong>use a bit lower temp around 90-92., and 1:15-16. <strong>Juliette and Lychello</strong> do well with a bit higher temp 94-96 and 1:16-17<br></p>\n<p>Current options:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Ninety Plus - Perci - Anaerobic natural - Gesha -</strong> Ninety Plus was the first to naturally process the gesha variety in Panama. Perci – short for perspective – is named for the sense of discovery and possibility with natural processing of coffee, which had its beginnings with game-changing events in 2007. <strong></strong>After bringing samples of its first experimental natural process coffees (fermented and dried in cherry) from Ethiopia to Panama in 2007 and sharing them with producer families in Boquete, a collaboration was made with Graciano Cruz of HiU Coffee and José David Garrido of Mama Cata to naturally process gesha for the first time for Ninety Plus. <strong>Tasting notes: </strong>Pineapple, grilled peach, pomegranate, chocolate ganache, port, winey, intense liquour, plum wine, funky spice. <strong>This coffee is intense, funky, and will punch you in the face. </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Ninety Plus - Juliette - Dry fermented/pulped - Gesha </strong>Named for its romantic and subtly seductive nature (2-time Chinese Champion and WBC finalist Jeremy Zhang is among her victims), Juliette is among the sweetest coffees produced by Ninety Plus. <strong></strong>Like rosé versus white or red, it manifests both the clarity of the classic floral and citrus profile of traditional gesha coffee while being balanced with depth and creaminess in the structure. <strong>Tasting notes: </strong>vanilla custard, cane sugar, peach, mango, yellow flowers, orange peel, baked stone fruit, light almond, lavender. <strong>This is clean, sweet, well structured, elegant, and sassy (spicy).</strong><br></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3.Ninety Plus - Lychello - Dry fermented washed - Gesha</strong>Inspired by the words “lychee” and “cello”, Lycello was the first taste profile created at Ninety Plus Gesha Estates in Panama. Lycello Batch 5 of 2014 was the first of 5 Ninety Plus coffees used to win the World Brewer’s Cup Championship. <strong>Tasting notes: </strong>Yuzu, lemon soda, raspberry, chamomile tea, butterscotch, ginger candy, lychee, orange blossom, melon. <strong>This coffee is a clean washed Panama Gesha, delicate and sweet.</strong><br></p>\n<p><strong>4. Ninety Plus - Kule - Dried in cherry / Proprietory process -</strong> <strong>Mixed Heirloom</strong> Ninety Plus considers all part of coffee plant in this processng process, utilizing the husk of the coffee and main ingredient in fermentation. This new formula is new for 2021 harvest. <strong>This coffee is electrifying in acidity and very not coffee like with notes that reminded us of Lime Candy, lemonade, rosehip, mint, juicy red grapes, and cantaloupe</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p> More about Ninety Plus Gesha Estate: <br></p>\n<p>Farm: Ninety Plus Gesha Estate<br>Location: Silla de Pando, Volcan, Republic of Panama<br>Terroir: Rich volcanic soil, only 400-500 years old<br>Elevation: 1500-1700 MASL<br></p>",
